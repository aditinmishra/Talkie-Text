Leptonica is an open source library containing software that is broadly useful for image processing and image analysis applications. Leptonica and trained data set is sent to the tesseract OCR engine. OCR Post Processing involves correcting errors that were generated during the OCR process. In the case that the OCRed text is a continuous thought written in a language that a reader understands, it is likely they could correct almost all errors. After the data is post-processed, the test is generated as an APIresponse.
